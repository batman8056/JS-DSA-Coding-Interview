What is an algorithm ?:
---------------------

->A Process or Set of steps to accomplish a 
 certain task.

->It's the foundation for being a 
  successful problem solving and developer.


How Do You Improve ?
------------------
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

Problem Solving:
---------------
1.understand the problem
2.Explore concrete examples
3.Break it Down
4.Solve/Simplify
5.Look Back and refactor

1.understand the problem
->can i restate the problem in my own words
->what are the inputs that go into the problem
->what are the outputs that sould come from the solution to the problem


2.Explore concrete examples
->Coming up with example can help you understand the problem better
->Start with simple example
->Progress to more Complex Example 
->Explore Examples with Empty inputs
->Explore Examples with Invalid inputs

3.Break it Down-(charCount.js)
->Explicity write out the steps you need to take.

4.Solve/Simplify
->Solving A Simpler Problem
->Find the core difficulty in what you're tring to Do
->Temporarily ignore that difficulty
->write simplified solution
->Then incorporate that difficulty back in

5.Look Back and refactor-(charCount.js)
