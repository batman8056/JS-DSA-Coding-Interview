Selection sort:-

->Similar to bubble sort but instead of first 
  place large values into sorted position, it place 
  small values into sorted position

$$$$$$$$$ Paeudocode $$$$$$$$
->Store the first element as the smallest value 
  you ve seen so far.

->compare this item to next item in the array until 
  you find a smaller number.

->if a smaller number is found, designate that 
  smaller numnber to be the new "minimum" and 
  continue until the end of the array.

->if the "minumum" is not the value (index) you 
  initial began with, swap the two values.
