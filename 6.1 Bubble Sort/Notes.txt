Elementary Sorting Algorithms:-

->Sorting is the process of rearranging 
  the items in a collection so that the items 
  are in some kind of order.

example :-
number from smaller to larger
names alphabetically
movies based on release year
movies based on revenue


built in javascript sort method:-

function compare(num1, num2){
    return num1 - num2;
    //return num2 - num1;/reverse order
}
[2,1,5,3,7,5,].sort(compare);

Bubble Sorting
--------------

->A sorting algorithm where the largest values 
  bubble up to the top!

->O(n)
