Recursion
*********
What is Recursion?
->A process (a function in our case)  that calls itself

The Call Stack:
->Any time a function is invoked it is placed(pushed)
  on the top of the call stack.

->when javaScript sees the return keyword or 
  when the function ends, the compiler will remove(pop).

How Recursion function work?
->Invoke the same function  with a diffrent input 
  until you reach your base case.

where things go wrong:-
-----------------------
->No base case
->Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
->stack overflow

Example:---
countDown.js
collectOdds.js
