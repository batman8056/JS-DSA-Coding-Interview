How do we Search?

->Given an array, the simplest way to search for 
 an value is to look at every element in the array 
 and check if it's the value we want.

Inbuild search methods:-
----------------------
-indexOf
-includes
-find
-findIndex

Linear Search:-

O(1) - best
O(n) - Average
O(n) - worst

Binary Search:-

O(log n) - worst and Average
O(n) - Best Case


Naive String Search:-

->Suppose you want to count the number of times 
 a smaller string appears in a longer string.

->A straightforword approach involes checking 
 pair of character individually.
