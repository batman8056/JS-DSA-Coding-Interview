How Do You Improve?
******************
1. Devise a plan for solving.
2. Master common problem solving pattern.

Some Pattern:-
-------------

*Frequency Counter
*Multiple Pointers
*Sliding Window
*Divide and Conquer
*Dynamic programming
* Greedy Algorithm
*Backtracking

1.Frequency Counters
->This pattern uses objects or sets to collect 
  values/Frequencies of values.

->This can often avoid the need for nested loop 
 or O(N^2) operations with arrays/String.
